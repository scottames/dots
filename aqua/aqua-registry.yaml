      vet is a command-line tool that acts as a safety net for the risky
      `curl | bash` pattern. It lets you inspect, diff against previous
      versions, and lint remote scripts before asking for your explicit approval
      to execute. Promoting a safer, more transparent way to handle remote code
      execution.
    supported_envs:
      - linux
