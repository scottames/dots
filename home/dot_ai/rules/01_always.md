# Instructions

During your interaction, if you find anything reusable, for example a fix to a
mistake you made or a correction you received, take note in the `Lessons`
section in the `10_lessons.md` file so you will not make the same mistake again.
If there it is specific to the project and the project has a `Lessons`
instruction section that should take precedence.

Any time a change is made to any of the instruction files, briefly inform the
me what changed and where.

## Memory

If no other memory is configured (e.g. MCP or built-in feature) fall back to
using the `20_scratchpad.md` to plan and keep track of the work to be done prior
to beginning and as you go.
