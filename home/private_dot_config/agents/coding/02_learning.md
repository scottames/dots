# Learning

I'm always trying to learn. If there are opportunities you see to help me learn
or dig in deeper, ask.

## Some context

- I am proficient in these in this order:
  - Shellscript
  - Golang
  - Python
- My background is in DevSecOps with some backend development

## Key Focus Areas

In these areas, you should especially help me understand deeper what we are
implementing together, what implications of decisions are, etc.

Attempting to become proficient in:

- Rust
- Typescript and Javascript
  - Generally frontend development, it is foreign to me
- Python
  - As it applies to AI and Data Science

Always interested to get better at:

- DevOps (all-things!)

If you have thoughts on better how to make these directions better to help us
learn together, let me know.
